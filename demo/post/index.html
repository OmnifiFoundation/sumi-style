                        In recent years data sovereignty has been gaining momentum as a foundational driver for various digital projects. If you missed our [introduction into data sovereignty](../introduction-to-data-sovereignty), we'd highly recommend you take the opportunity to read it before going further. We'll not explain data sovereignty in this article.

                        Predominently the projects fall into one of two categories: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distributed data storage, often backed by varying approaches to zero-knowledge proofs, and;</li>
                            <li>Politically-driven programs to develop regional competitive data markets to reduce the dependency on US tech companies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a lot of conversation has emerged from projects in both of these camps, those conversations rarely discuss human needs when it comes to data sovereignty.
